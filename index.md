title: I build iOS applications
---

## I'm a iOS developer.

I write Objective C/Swift for view layer (views, animations, etc.) and for backend layer (network calls, data management, etc.). I design databases in Core Data. I am full-stack.

## I'm also a front-end web developer.

I write HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I turn design comps into web pages. I make things look the same across different browsers.

## DevOps

I do that too. I can set up continuous integration/delivery, servers, and keep things running. I can write various scripts in order to make a developer life easier.
